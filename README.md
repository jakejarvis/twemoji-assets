# ðŸ“¦ twemoji-assets

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/twemoji-assets)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twemoji-assets)

A _very_ simple NPM package that downloads [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) emojis (PNG and SVG) on installation. Version numbers align with [Twemoji releases](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/releases).

## Usage

Graphics will be located relative to your project root in:

- `node_modules/twemoji-assets/vendor/72x72` for 72px PNGs.
- `node_modules/twemoji-assets/vendor/svg` for vector SVGs.

Other assets such as the JS files still need to be added to your project separately via the [official `twemoji` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twemoji) if you require them.

**Note:** This exists mainly for [my own convenience](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is) and was thrown together in literally two minutes. Improvements welcome!
